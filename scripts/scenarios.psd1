    # KenshiCoop scenario manifest - the single declarative source of truth for
    # WHICH oracles judge each scenario, which save/setup it needs, and which
    # regression tier it belongs to. Consumed by CoopOracles.psm1 (oracle
    # dispatch + verdict rule), run_test.ps1 (save/setup defaults, gating),
    # regress.ps1 (tier matrices) and analyze_run.ps1 (offline verdicts).
    #
    # Per-scenario fields:
    #   Save        - save both clients load (must exist in %LOCALAPPDATA%\kenshi\save)
    #   Setup       - host-only KENSHICOOP_SETUP scene ('' = none)
    #   Tolerance   - default cross-check tolerance (world units)
    #   PrimaryGate - the mechanism proof. FAIL **or SKIP** of this gate fails
    #                 the run (the no-signal guard): a green run must prove its
    #                 core mechanism was actually judged.
    #   Gating      - oracle ids that gate the verdict (FAIL fails the run; SKIP
    #                 is tolerated unless the oracle is the PrimaryGate)
    #   Advisory    - oracle ids that are measured + recorded but never gate
    #   Tier        - 'smoke' (per-pipeline sample) | 'full' | 'none' (diagnostic)
    #   WanVariant  - $true: the full tier reruns this scenario under the WAN
    #                 proxy (profile 'bad') as a second, separately-reported run
    #   Bounds      - per-scenario threshold overrides, @{ <oracleId> = @{ <Param> = <value> } }.
    #                 Only the ids/params in CoopOracles' Get-OracleBoundSpec are
    #                 accepted, and Contract.Tests.ps1 rejects anything else, so a
    #                 mistyped bound fails the check instead of silently doing
    #                 nothing. Prefer a bound over WanDemote: a demoted gate stops
    #                 judging the scenario at all, where a bound keeps judging it
    #                 at its own number.
    #   WanBounds   - same shape, overlaid on Bounds when the run is under the proxy
    #
    # Smoke-tier selection principle: ONE scenario per wire pipeline, preferring
    # the bidirectional superset (it strictly covers the unidirectional case):
    #   coop_presence     - unreliable entity stream + ownership partition
    #   npc_sync          - interest-managed world NPCs + intent/task/pose
    #   combat_kill       - reliable event channel + attribution + outcome
    #   inv_bidir         - inventory snapshot/reconcile (both directions)
    #   world_weapon_drop - world-item conservation channel
    #   world_armor_drop  - same channel, EQUIPPED armor piece (real-session repro)

        # from the mover - inside the host's 2500 u census reach, so not an
        # enumeration horizon - that reads as host 12 bodies vs join 18,
        # duplicated by ROLE: 2 Barmen where there is one bar, 6 Ninja Guards
        # vs 4, 8 Hungry bandits vs 5. The join's second Barman goes
        # drv -> ghost -> hid over ~15-30 s and then runs its own AI invisibly.

        # the host doesn't") describes.

        # The CAUSE is still open, and this harness cannot settle it: both
        # installs auto-load the same %LOCALAPPDATA%\kenshi\save folder and the
        # host's connect-push bakes into that folder WHILE the join reads it,
        # so what the join loads is a race. Varying -JoinDelaySec looks causal
        # (host solo before bake 15/68/128 s -> 7-12/2/0 join-only platoons)
        # but deferring the bake in the plugin instead, holding the settle time
        # at 120 s while the join launched normally, gave 13 - the worst
        # measured. The stagger was moving the join's load relative to the
        # host's WRITE, nothing more. See REPLICATION_PITFALLS.md section 13.
        #
        # Ruled out as causes: census truncation (n=43-51, none), staleness

        # mint path (1 proxy bound all run, the rest deferred past mintR=600).
        #
        # Two harness traps this uncovered, both fixed in run_test.ps1: a
        # stagger longer than KENSHICOOP_ARM_TIMEOUT_MS makes the host arm
        # ALONE and finish before the join starts (use -ArmTimeoutMs), and
        # -Seconds/-KillGraceSec must grow with the stagger or the games die
        # before RESULT.
        #
        # Do not trust the per-phase popMover/popStay medians to show any of
        # this - suppression drops the extras out of the spatial query, so the
        # counts agree while the identities do not. Diff the platoon sets.

        # town, so both clients read the same baked bodies and the hands match:
        # measured in Bad Teeth from a save, 78% of the host's census rows resolve
        # to a local body and 9% of the join's population is suppressed. That is
        # not how a player meets a town. Walk into one and each engine GENERATES
        # its population as the zone streams in: same spawn points, different
        # hands. The join then cannot resolve the host's census, mints proxies for
        # all of it, and suppresses its own natively-spawned bodies as unclaimed -
        # the same town walked into measured 4% resolved and 68% suppressed, with
        # 225 proxy binds and 264 census-missing rows (session 20260806_1224). On
        # screen: a town of NPCs popping in and out. Loading that same town from a
        # save made it go away, which is what isolated it to zone load time and is
        # why this scenario has to arrive on foot.
