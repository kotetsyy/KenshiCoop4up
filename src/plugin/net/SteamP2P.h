// SteamP2P - Steam P2P datagram transport over Kenshi's own steam_api64.dll.
//
// Kenshi ships the legacy ISteamNetworking P2P API (SendP2PPacket/ReadP2PPacket,
// confirmed in the DLL's flat exports; interface era SteamClient017/SteamUser019).
// Valve brokers connections BY STEAMID: UDP NAT hole-punch first, silent relay
// through Valve's network when punching fails. That removes IPs, port forwarding
// and router/CGNAT problems from the co-op session entirely.
//
// Design: this module does NOT replace the wire protocol - it is a datagram pipe.
// NetLink keeps running the stock ENet protocol (HELLO/WELCOME, channels,
// reliability, reconnect); the vendored ENet's socket layer is redirected here
// via enet_set_socket_hooks() (patch 0002), so every ENet datagram rides one
// unreliable Steam P2P packet on channel 0. UDP stays the default transport.
//
// Star topology: the HOST may tunnel to up to 3 joins; each JOIN tunnels to
// one host. Sending to a SteamID implicitly accepts its inbound session.
// Host can setAllowAny(true) and accept inbound peers as they send (F2 ONLINE
// with no pasted ids, or extra lobby members after the session is up).
//
// Threading: init()/setPeer()/addPeer()/setPingPeer() are called on the main
// thread; the ENet hooks and tick() run on the net thread. The peer list is
// guarded by a CRITICAL_SECTION. The flat ISteamNetworking calls are
// thread-safe (IPC into the Steam client).
