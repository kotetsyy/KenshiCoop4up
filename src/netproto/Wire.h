// So the receiver states it. One ack per intent, reliable, carrying how many
// units actually landed:
//   applied == quantity  ACCEPT  - the author drops its latches now, not on a
//                                  timer, and the two worlds agree immediately
//   0 < applied < qty    PARTIAL - the author keeps a latch for the shortfall

// channel used to publish belongs to NPC/town squads and reads 0 for the
// player's own tabs - which is why that channel synced a field the economy
// ignores). Both players therefore spend from ONE pool, and the host's engine
// wallet IS that pool.
//
// The pool has two writers, so absolute snapshots would LOSE updates: if both
// players buy from 1000 - one spending 200, the other 300 - exchanged totals
// overwrite each other and one purchase becomes free. The join therefore sends
// the CHANGE (MoneyDeltaPacket) and the host publishes the authoritative TOTAL.
//
// Host -> join: the authoritative pool total, change-gated with a safety
// resend. ackSeq is the highest join delta already folded into that total, so
// the join can re-apply its still-unacked deltas on top instead of watching a
// fresh purchase revert and then re-apply. money is signed because the engine
// field is an int (the host clamps the pool at 0).

// ---- Protocol 24: player-faction relation row --------------------------------

// faction_probe run 132239; the same identity protocol 21 round-trips for

// receiver writes BOTH local rows via FactionRelations::setRelation. The
// channel is SYMMETRIC: each client streams rows its own table moved
// (change-gated vs a seeded baseline, ~1 Hz sample or immediate on a
// detoured affectRelations mutation) and applies whatever arrives; the
// receiver updates its baseline BEFORE writing, so an applied row is never
// re-detected as a local change (echo-free). seq is per-sender monotonic so
// a stale row never overwrites a newer one on either side.

// The host's absolute in-game clock (GameWorld::getTimeStamp_inGameHours, in
// total campaign hours - time_probe run 141509 proved it save-derived and
// advancing at exactly frameSpeedMult x the base rate). ~1 Hz on CH_RELIABLE.
// The receiver computes the offset against its own clock and corrects by
// SLEWING: it quietly scales its local sim speed on top of the arbitrated
// consensus speed until the offset is inside tolerance (there is no engine
// setter for the clock base; a slew converges without one and never makes the
// clock jump or run backwards).
//
// BOTH sides send, because each can only slew one way. The join catches up by
// running faster, which the 5x clamp on the slewed speed makes a no-op at a
// travelling session's 5x; the host is then the only one with room, and slows
// itself to be caught (the clock brake). The correction is always LOCAL to the
// sender of it - what crosses the wire is this clock and the unslewed consensus
// speed. At the default hour length (~109 real-seconds per game hour) 50 ms of
// wire latency is ~0.0005 game hours - ignorable, so no RTT compensation. seq
// is per-sender monotonic (stale-sample guard).

// ---- Protocol 26: baked-door open/lock state ----------------------------------
// One door/gate state row, keyed by the door Building's save-stable hand (the

// intersection on the shared save). SYMMETRIC change-gated channel: each
// client samples doors near its interest centers ~1 Hz, streams rows whose
// (open, locked) moved vs a seeded per-hand baseline, and applies received
// rows through the engine's own openDoor/closeDoor/lockDoor/unlockDoor -
// updating the baseline BEFORE the write, so an applied row is never
// re-detected as a local change (echo-free). seq is per-sender monotonic so
// a stale row never overwrites a newer one. open is the collapsed DESTINATION
// state (OPENING counts as open, CLOSING as closed) so a door mid-swing never
// publishes a transient. A receiver that cannot resolve the hand skips the
// row silently (out-of-interest or a runtime-placed door - accepted edge).

// ---- Protocol 54: property-deed (building ownership) ------------------------
// One building-ownership row, keyed by the building's save-stable hand - the
// same identity the door channel above round-trips, and valid here for the same
// reason: a bought house/shop is a BAKED object both clients loaded from the
// shared save (unlike a PLACED building, whose runtime hand needs the protocol
// 27 translation map).
//
// This is a LATCHED SET channel on the protocol-38 research shape, NOT the
// protocol-26 door shape, and the difference is the whole point. A door row is
// a transient toggle whose next sample self-heals, so the door channel drops a
// row whose hand does not resolve locally. Ownership is a persistent fact, and
// the buyer is standing at the building while the partner may be a continent
// away with that zone unloaded - dropping that row would reproduce the exact
// bug this channel exists to fix. So deeds send with resendUnsent, and a
// receiver that cannot resolve the hand yet leaves the row unapplied for the
// safety resend to retry.
//
// SYMMETRIC: either client may buy, per-sender seq drops stale rows. ADDITIVE
// in practice - an owned=0 row is only ever published from an OBSERVED
// transition on a building that resolves locally, because a hand merely absent
// from the local owned set means "unloaded/unknown", never "sold".
//
// ownerSid names the NEW owning faction (the player faction for owned=1, the
// seller for owned=0), so the un-own direction is fully specified by the packet
// rather than by a baseline the receiver may never have seeded - a building
// already owned in the save has no recorded town owner to restore.
//
// The receiver applies a PURE STATE WRITE (setFaction + add/removeOwnedObject)
// and NEVER Building::buyMeCallback: that would debit the cats a second time,
// and publishMoneyPool detects wallet movement by sampling, so the pool would
// then re-publish the deduction as a fresh local spend. The payer's cats
// already ride protocol 52.

// ---- Protocol 55: runtime-fixture identity ----------------------------------
// An IDENTITY channel, not a state channel: it carries no gameplay value, only
// the mapping "the fixture I call H is the one you can find at P with template
// S". Everything else about machines (protocol 33 buffers, protocol 34 contents,
// the Stage 5 work pose) keeps its existing wire shape and simply resolves its
// key through the map this builds.
//
// Why it exists (2026-08-09 mine sync). Ore/stone MINES are not save objects.
// Each client instantiates its own production building for a terrain resource
// node, so the same physical mine carries a DIFFERENT hand - different index AND
// different serial - on each side, while its world position is identical to the
// decimetre (the node is terrain data). Measured on the mine1 save, same moment,
// same character hand on both clients:
//
//   [HOST] [seatres] npc=1,32592774 subj=50,2399902464   subjpos=-51566.5,-2515.7
//   [JOIN] [seatres] npc=1,32592774 subj=104,1377319296  subjpos=-51566.5,-2515.7
//
// Every consumer of that hand therefore failed on the peer: applyTaskOrder
// returned 1 ("fixture not loaded here") and latched taskBad, so a mining body
// parked with no animation; applyProd dropped every buffer row silently; the
// container snapshot reconciled into nothing. Both reported bugs - "the mining
// animation only appears on the miner's own PC" and "the mine's inventory does
// not sync" - are that one unresolvable hand.
//
// The fix is the protocol-27 precedent (a placed building's runtime hand crosses
// in the PLACER's key space with a receiver-side translation map), generalized
// to fixtures nobody placed. The wire key is the SENDER's local hand; the
// receiver matches position + template to its own copy and remembers the pair.
//
// SYMMETRIC: each client announces the fixtures near its own interest centers,
// because the pose path is bidirectional (either side may drive the other's
// miner) and protocol 33/34 are host-authored. Static rows - a fixture's
// position and template never change - so this is first-sight plus a slow
// safety resend, and a party standing still is silent.
//
// SCOPE is deliberately the container/machine classes (STORAGE plus the machine
// set), i.e. exactly what enumContainersNear already walks. Seats and beds are
// SAVE-BAKED: their hands match across clients (which is why bed_pose passes),
// so they need no translation and are not announced. Restricting what is
// ANNOUNCED - rather than gating consumers by task type - is what keeps the
// furniture protocols on their existing, validated path: a seat hand is never in
// the map, so the translation is a no-op for it.
//
// A receiver that cannot match the row yet (zone not loaded) simply records
// nothing; the safety resend retries, and every consumer falls back to the raw
// hand, which is still correct for a genuinely save-baked machine.
